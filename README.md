# OT Security Lab: UIUC CS 460 / ECE 419 - Security Laboratory

Welcome to the main branch for the OT Security Lab for UIUC course CS 460 / EC
419 - Security Laboratory on 11/29/2023.

This lab contains four separate activities, each of which builds upon the
previous activity, with each activity being contained in a separate branch in
this repo.

In order to get started, create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) account (if you
don't already have one) and then deploy the initial Gitpod workspace for this
lab using the following URL:

[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/patsec/uiuc-lab/tree/branch-00](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ITI/ICS_Virtualization_Testbed-wind_turbine/tree/branch-00)

Once deployed, follow the instructions in the README located in the workspace.
